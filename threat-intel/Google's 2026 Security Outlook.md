## Key Predictions & Trends

### AI as Attack & Defense Tool
Google forecasts AI will significantly amplify both offensive and defensive capabilities in 2026. Threat actors are expected to leverage AI for faster reconnaissance, personalized phishing at scale, and automated vulnerability exploitation. Simultaneously, defenders will deploy AI agents for threat detection, incident response automation, and proactive vulnerability discovery.

### Identity & Access Management Critical
With the expanding attack surface from cloud adoption and remote work, identity-based attacks will remain a primary threat vector. Organizations must prioritize zero-trust architectures and robust identity governance.

### Supply Chain Security Intensifies
Software supply chain attacks will continue to evolve, requiring enhanced vendor risk management, SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) adoption, and continuous monitoring of third-party dependencies.

### Regulatory Pressure Increases
Expect stricter cybersecurity regulations globally, particularly around data privacy, breach disclosure timelines, and critical infrastructure protection. Compliance will become more complex as requirements vary by jurisdiction.

### Cloud Security Maturity Gap
While cloud adoption accelerates, many organizations still struggle with proper cloud security configurations. Misconfigurations and inadequate access controls will remain leading causes of cloud breaches.

## My Takeaways
- The dual nature of AI in security is becoming reality - not just theoretical anymore
- Need to focus on identity security fundamentals alongside emerging AI threats
- Cloud misconfigurations are still low-hanging fruit for attackers despite increased awareness

## Questions to Explore
- What specific zero-trust implementations are most effective for small-to-medium organizations?
- How can defenders keep pace with AI-accelerated attacks without massive budgets?
- What skills should I prioritize to stay relevant in this AI-augmented security landscape?
