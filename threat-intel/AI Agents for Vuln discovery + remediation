## AI Agents for Vulnerability Discovery & Remediation

**Google DeepMind's Big Sleep**: Google's AI agent successfully discovered a real exploitable zero-day vulnerability in SQLite before it was deployed to production - marking the first public instance of AI finding a previously unknown memory safety issue in widely-used software. This demonstrates AI moving from theoretical threat to practical defensive tool.

- **Zeropath**: Agentic system for security testing and vulnerability assessment ([Link](https://zeropath.com/))

There are many other examples such as the Agent from HackerOne, Microsoft's Intune and Vuln.AI and many others. 

Additionally, agentic applications for Blockchain and DeFi protocols are increasingly being developed. This was the main theme highlighted for efficient smart contract auditing in the 2025 DeFi Security Summit.

**Trend**: Major AI labs are trying to deploy security-focused agents for both offensive (vuln discovery) and defensive (automated patching) purposes.
