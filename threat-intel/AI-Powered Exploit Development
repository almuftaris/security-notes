## AI-Powered Exploit Development Breakthrough
A security researcher successfully used Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2 to automatically generate over 40 working exploits for a zero-day vulnerability in QuickJS. The AI agents independently developed exploit primitives, bypassed modern mitigations like ASLR and CFI, and solved complex challenges in under an hour for around $30-50 in API costs. This demonstrates that exploit development is becoming "industrialized" - The core idea of this writeup is that an organization's hacking capability in the future will primarily be limited by their API token budget as opposed to the number of skilled hackers they employ. In this regard, Sean Heelan highlights the risk of AI automating vulnerability discovery and exploitation especially for groups that aren't constrained by resources or budgets. 

**Key Concern**: Current models can already do this against smaller targets. What happens when they're used on real applications and web browsers like Chrome or FireFox that serve economies across the globe?
